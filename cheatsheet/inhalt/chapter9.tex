\section{Linear dynamical systems}
\subsection{Linear dynamical systems}
$x_{t+1} = A_tx_t$ , t = 1,2,. . .\\
\textbullet $A_t$ are n × n dynamics matrices
\textbullet $(A_t)_{ij}(x_t)_j
is contribution to (x_{t+1})_i
from (x_t)_j$\\
\textbullet system is called time-invariant if $A_t = A$ doesn't depend on time\\
\textbullet can simulate evolution of xt using recursion $x_{t+1} = A_tx$\\
\textbullet linear dynamical system with input\\
$x_{t+1} = A_tx_t + B_tu_t + c_t$, t = 1,2,...\\
\thickspace -- $u_t$ is an input m-vector\\
\thickspace -- $B_t$ is n × m input matrix\\
\thickspace -- $c_t$ is offset\\
\textbf{K-Markov model}:\\
$x_{t+1} = A_1x_t + ... + A_Kx_{t-K+1}$, t = K,K + 1,...\\
\thickspace -- next state depends on current state and K - 1 previous states\\
\thickspace – also known as auto-regresssive model\\
\thickspace – for K = 1, this is the standard linear dynamical system $x_{t+1} = Ax_t$\\
\subsection{Population dynamics}

\subsection{Epidemic dynamics}
\textbullet \textbf{Susceptible:} These individuals can acquire the disease the next day. \newline
\textbullet \textbf{Infected:} These individuals have the disease.
\textbullet \textbf{Recovered/(immune) :} These individuals had the disease and survived,and now have immunity. \newline
\textbullet \textbf{Deceased:} These individuals had the disease, and unfortunately died from it.

Example: $x_{t} = [0.75, 0.10, 0.10, 0.05]$

We can determine number of susceptible individuals for the next day, i.e., $x_{t+1}$

$x_{t+1} = Mat(n x n)*x_{t}$

\newline

$x_{t+1} = Mat[n x n]*x_{t}$
where Mat[n x n] is set of assumptions made by the model.

\subsection{Motion of a mass}
Linear dynamical systems can be used to describe motion of mechanical objects. The (scalar) position of the mass at time $\tau$ is given by
$p(\tau )$.
PDE for position:
$m \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial \tau^{2}} ( \tau ) =  -  \eta  \frac{\partial p}{\partial \tau} (\tau) +   f(\tau)$
m > 0 is the mass, $f(\tau )$ is the external force acting on the mass at time $\tau$ ,and $ \eta > 0$ is the drag coefficient.
